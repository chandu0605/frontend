        About Cricket</center></u></h1>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field,<br> at the centre of which is a <strong> 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot)</strong> pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising <i>two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. </i><u>Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker,</u>stand in front of either wicket holding bats,<br> while one player from the fielding team, the bowler,<br> <b>bowls the ball toward the striker's </b>wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker,<br> with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges.<br> Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>
    <h2>History of Cricket</h2>
    <p>Cricket <mark>originated in England in the late 16th century and became popular in the 18th century.</mark> It spread to other parts of the world with the expansion of the British Empire. </p>
    <h3><u>Dfination of Cricket</u></h3>
    <p>A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term "cricket". In the earliest definite reference, it was spelled creckett. The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff, or the French word criquet meaning a wooden post.[4] The Middle Dutch word krickstoel means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[9] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").[10]

        It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the County of Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, many Middle Dutch[11] words found their way into southern English dialects.[12]</p>
